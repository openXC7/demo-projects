The AllAboutFPGA[dot]com EdgeZ7-20 development board is not currently supported by OpenFPGALoader. 
However, it uses the same SoC as the PYNQ-Z1, the Xilinx Zynq-7020 (part number XC7Z020-1CLG400C), 
and features an FTDI FT2232H for programming. 

To enable support in OpenFPGALoader, I have applied the same configuration settings as those used 
for the PYNQ-Z1 in the makefile. 

I am currently coordinating with the OpenFPGALoader team to officially add support for the EdgeZ7-20 board. 
Once support is added, I will update the configuration accordingly.
